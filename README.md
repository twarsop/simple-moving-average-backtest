# Overview

The file sma.ipynb in this repo contains the Jupyter notebook for the interactive demo of a simple moving average (SMA) trading strategy.

There are comments throughout this notebook that should guide you through how an SMA trading strategy works. You can provide your own set of parameters to get stock data and to the SMA trading strategy itself. Graphs and summary statistics also show you the results of using an SMA trading strategy for the selected stock, date range and trading strategy parameter.
